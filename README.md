# `R Howto` series

This series of tutorials is intended to help people achieve specific tasks with the R language. They suppose knowledge of the basics of the language and target specific use cases. They try to cover the most common issues for each task and suggest additional functions for more advanced aspects. They rely heavily on modern packages rather than base R, especially when those provide a simpler interface for the task at hand.

Each tutorial is published on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/ "RPubs").

In this series you will find:

*   [HOWTO deal with date and time in R](http://rpubs.com/jo_irisson/howto_date_time): parsing date and time from text, dealing with julian date and time, computing with dates and times, dealing with timezones, etc.
